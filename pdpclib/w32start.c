   dependency on msvcrt.dll will have caused it to be loaded first.
   And it was built with PDPCLIB_DLL and included dllcrt.c, and the
   entry point DllMainCRTStartup will be called, which does a call
   to __start, and that call (part of the DLL) exits early - before
   calling main(). So then, when the main executable is loaded,
   mainCRTStartup is then called, and the only thing that hasn't
   been done (for whatever reason, presumably design choice) is
   parsing the parameters. The DLL has a function (getmainargs)
   to do that too, so that is now called */
